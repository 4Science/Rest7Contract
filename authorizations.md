# Authorizations Endpoints
[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

An authorizations is the representation of some rights that are available to a specific user (eperson) on a defined object, eventually the whole repository (site object).
All the authorizations are always explicitly listed regardless to how they are grant, by direct policies via groups' membership or open to everyone (anonymous users).

## Main Endpoint
**/api/authz/authorizations**

As we don't have yet an use case to iterate over all the existent authorizations the main endpoint is not implemented and a 405 error code is returned according to our [general error response codes](README.md#Error-codes).

## Single Authorization
**/api/authz/authorizations/<:id>**

Provide detailed information about a specific authorization. The JSON response document is as follow

```json
{
  "id": [eperson-uuid_]feature-id_object-uuid,
  "type": "authorization"
}
```

Attributes
* id: the id of the authorization resource is defined by the combination of the eperson uuid (if not null), the feature id and the object uuid joined with an underscore 

Exposed links:
* eperson: link to the eperson that the authorization belong to. Can be null for authorizations grant to unlogged users
* feature: link to the feature enabled by this authorization
* object: link to the object where this authorization apply. Not limited to DSpace objects, see the controlled list defined for the type attribute in the [features endpoint](features.md) for more details

Return codes:
* 200 OK - if the operation succeed
* 401 Forbidden - if you are not authenticated and the policy is not related to the ANONYMOUS user (eperson null)
* 403 Unauthorized - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only system administrators and the user mentioned in the authorization can access
* 404 Not found - if the authorization doesn't exist (or was already deleted)

### Search methods
#### object
**/api/authz/authorizations/search/object?uri=<:uri>[&eperson=<:uuid>&feature=<:string>]**

The supported parameters are:
* page, size [see pagination](README.md#Pagination)
* uri: mandatory, the object to use for the authorization check. The full URI of the rest resource must be specified, i.e. https://{dspace.url}/api/core/community/{uuid}
* eperson: optional, the uuid of the eperson to evaluate for authorization. If not specified authorization of anonymous users will be returned
* feature: optional, limit the returned authorization to the specified feature (this provide an alternative to codify the authorization id rule on the client side)

It returns the list of matching authorizations. Please note that all the matching authorizations available for the requested user will be returned including the one available to anonymous users. There is no need on the client side to combine the authorizations of the current, logged-in, user with the authorizations of anonymous users. 

Return codes:
* 200 OK - if the operation succeed
* 400 Bad Request - if the uuid parameter is missing or invalid
* 401 Forbidden - if you are not authenticated and an eperson is specified
* 403 Unauthorized - if you are not logged in with sufficient permissions. Only system administrators and the user specified in the eperson parameter can access

## Other HTTP verbs than GET
No other verbs are supported right now. Authorizations cannot be grant or revoke directly, they are generated by the system via interaction with other endpoint such as the resourcepolicies, the submission, the workflow, etc.
