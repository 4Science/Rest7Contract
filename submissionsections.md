# Submission-Sections Endpoints
[Back to the list of all defined endpoints](endpoints.md)

A submission-section represents a single section in the submission process. Depending on its type, it may include a configurable input form (if type='submission-form'). However, not all sections are currently configurable, and other types of steps include file upload, embargo/access rights, creative commons licensing, etc.
A list of the [available sectionType is provided here](submissionsection-types.md)

## Main Endpoint
**/api/config/submissionsections**   

Provide access to the configured submission sections. It returns the list of existent submission-sections.

Example: to be provided

## Single Submission-Definition
**/api/config/submissionsections/<:section-name>**

Provide detailed information about a specific submission-section. The JSON response document is as follow
```json
{
  	id: "id-of-the-submission-form-page",
  	header: "First page",
  	mandatory: true,
  	sectionType: "submission-form",
  	visibility: {
      "workflow": "hidden"
    },
  	type: "submissionsection",
  	_links: {
  		"config" : "<dspace-url>/config/submissionforms/<:id-of-the-submission-form-page>" 
  	}
}
```

* the *header* attribute is the label or the i18n key to use to present the section to the user
* the *mandatory* attribute defines if the section MUST be used by each submission. Otherwise, the user is allowed to enable/disable the section interacting with the workspaceitem
* visibility: the *visibility* nested attributes explain if and how a section should be used in a specific scope (i.e. the submission, the workflow and the edit). Each attribute can assume one of the following values  
    * `null` : omitted means editable
    * `hidden`: not available in the scope defined by the attribute name
    * `read-only`: not alterable in the scope
    
    For example `visibility :{"submission" : "read-only", "workflow": "hidden"}` would imply that the section is visible in read-only mode during the submission and not present at all during the workflow. `visibility :{"workflow": "read-only"}` means that the section can be input during the submission but not modified during the workflow.
    Cisibility constraints set at the section level can be only further restricted by specific configuration of the section such as the visibility for submissionform. For example if a section is hidden the visibility settings of the single field in the form is ignored. If the section is readonly the visibility of some fields can be eventually only reduced to hidden, higher visibility will be automatically limited to "read-only"
* the *sectionType* attribute defines the kind of section that the UI will need to use to interact with the data. See the [documentation about the available values for sectionType provided here](submissionsection-types.md)


## Linked Entities
### config

It returns the endpoint to use to access a detailed, sectionType dependent, configuration to be used in the panel. Such as the list of fields to include in a form based panel, the upload and access condition options for an upload panel, etc.
